/** Represents a Vehicle.Vehicle.Car Repair Shop.
 *
 * A Vehicle.Vehicle.Car Repair Shop loads a number of cars, up to a maximum number that can vary between different workshops.
 * Some workshops should only be able to accommodate a certain type of car;
 * others can receive any car.
 * Trying to receive the "wrong" sort of car in a workshop should give a static (compile time) error.
 * When retrieving a car from the workshop, we must be able to get as specific static type information as possible.
 * Example: A car retrieved from a branded workshop that only handles the Volvo 240 should have static type Vehicle.Volvo240.
 * @param <C> a class that extends the Vehicle.Vehicle.Car, either the Vehicle.Volvo240 or Vehicle.Saab95 class
