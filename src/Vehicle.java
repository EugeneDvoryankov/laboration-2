 * The vehicle's current x coordinate
 * The vehicle's current y coordinate
 * The number of doors on the vehicle
 * The engine power of the vehicle
 * The current speed of the vehicle
 * The vehicle's color
 * The vehicle's modelName.
 * Has getters and setters for all attributes except setters for x and y coordinate.
 * Also contains gas and brake methods which in turn contain incrementSpeed and decrementSpeed methods,
